			<p style="text-align:justify">Tata Young, Asia’s Queen of Pop was born in Bangkok, Thailand on December 14, 1980. The daughter of an American father and a Thai mother, she grew up surrounded by music and dance. She was inspired one night while watching TV of a star search talent show and with her parents support; she began to realize her dreams. At the tender age of 11, Tata out performed 5,300 other young children to be crowned winner of the International Junior Singing Contest, she sang her convincing rendition of “One Night Only”. She caught the attention of a music executive and went on to recorded her first solo album “Amita Tata Young” which sold more than 1 million units in just 5 months. At only 15, Tata was billed Thailand’s biggest pop sensation, a standing which was cemented when sales of her follow up album “Tata 1,000,000 Copies Celebration” also surpassed the million marks.</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify">In 2004 Tata hit the international market with her first English debut album: “I Believe”. The record hit 9x platinum in her home country; and achieved the amazing feat of selling more than one 1,000,000 copies across Asia including over 300,000 units in Japan; earning her “Best International Artist of The Year 2005 award” by the Recording Industry Association Japan. During the same year Tata also sang the theme song to the Bollywood blockbuster film Dhoom, whose OST album sold over 800,000 units in India, a phenomenal success for a soundtrack.</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify">Today, this music veteran has sold more than 14 million albums and continues to be a symbol of energy and change in the Asian music industry. She remains one of the most popular performers in the region and is a perennial "favorite" by magazines and music channels.</p>
